title: A Month Passed
---
A month has passed since my last post and I'm surprised to say I would be writing another one. A new post suggests something new to share. This post, I want to write about my latest project, Dog Art.

Last month, I set a goal to develop a photo library with images and data pulled from an API. Conveniently, my favorite art museum, the Cleveland Art Museum, had just released an API of their collection. My idea was to create a viewing experience similar to being at a museum, but with a dog theme (Dogs and dog paintings are my favorite). Though, creating the dog theme became problematic. The data pulled from this new API was not very clean. When performing a query for "dog", about 65% of the data either had a dog mentioned in text or there was no reference to a string "dog" at all. Alas, the site was themed anyway.

My experience with this project was that it is really fun to work with data, design layouts, and write, I hope, clean Javascript. Working with this API inspires me to work with and write cleaner JSON data.
